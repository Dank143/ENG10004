The HD project is the Wearable EMG-Controlled Robotic Claw. The project uses an EMG sensor to create two applications. The first application is to create an instant heart rate monitor which should be able to accurately keep track of users heart rate. The second application is to build a wearable EMG-controlled robotic claw which can be worn on the user’s forearm and controlled through the user’s muscle contraction to grasp objects. This device is expected to help patients with mobility issues to grasp and pick up objects. The project is made using MATLAB.
